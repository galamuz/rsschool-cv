      <li>Summary (your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why.
        Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her
        passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldnâ€™t think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the
        workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
        learning new things from everywhere etc.).</li>

        freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
